# Strapi v4 docker codebase

## Usage
- Don't eat that! for sure, lmaooo
- This one aims to make a product ready Strapi V4 CMS image, which can be deployed anywhere, from on-premise server to K8S, Cloud...

## How to use 
- The repo integrated eslint and [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) so you can freely config it as documented on their homepage. Rules also defined but you can change to your taste without restriction
- ESLint run on vscode autoformat on save. To disable it (not recommended) go to `.vscode/settings.json` and comment out all the lines
- To change rules, go to `.eslintrc` file `rules` section

## How it can be product ready strapi?
- take a look into `backend/Dockerfile` for more details

## Note
- Lacking of test, of course, I'm working on it..
- Lacking of CI CD flow, that should be exists from day 1.
